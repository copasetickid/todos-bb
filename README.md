### Todo App - Backbone Version

Extends from the Udacity JS Design Patterns Course to include the following features(still in progress)
* Let the user set the priority status when creating the todo item
* Let users filter or sort by priority status
* Expand the priority feature to have more than two levels
* Add a recycle bin for recovering deleted todos
* Add colors, so people can associate different todos with each other
* Add labels for sorting and filtering
